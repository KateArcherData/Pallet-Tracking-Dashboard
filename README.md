# üì¶ Pallet Tracking & Efficiency Dashboard

A Power BI project analysing pallet movements, return performance, and operational efficiency using a synthetic logistics dataset.
This dashboard demonstrates how data can be used to identify pallet losses, improve turnaround times, and highlight warehouse and customer performance.

---

## üîç Dashboard Overview

The Power BI report is structured across three pages, each designed to answer key business questions and provide actionable insight.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Overview Dashboard
Provides high-level visibility of key performance indicators (KPIs):
- **Return Rate:** 79.4%
- **Loss Rate:** 10.2%
- **Average Turnaround Time:** 6.92 days
- **On-Time Deliveries:** 81.6%

Visuals include:
- Pallet status breakdown (Returned, Late Return, Lost, In Transit)
- Monthly trends for pallet movements
- Condition analysis (Good vs Damaged)
- Date range slicer for time-based filtering

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Warehouse & Customer Insights
Evaluates performance by location and customer, helping to pinpoint where inefficiencies occur.
- **Return Rate by Warehouse**
- **Loss Rate by Top 10 Customers**
- **Customer Performance Summary Table** (Return %, Loss %, Turnaround)
- **Interactive slicers** for Warehouse and Customer

This page highlights which warehouses are most efficient and which customers have the highest loss or delay rates.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Delay & Performance Analysis
Explores how delays impact overall turnaround efficiency.
- **Average Delay vs Turnaround by Warehouse**
- **Average Delay by Customer**
- **Trend of Turnaround Days Over Time**
- KPIs for *Average Delay*, *Average Turnaround*, and *On-Time %*

A scatter and line analysis were used to visualise relationships between delay days and turnaround time, supporting data-driven operational improvements.

---

## üß† Key Insights
- 79% of pallets were returned within expected timeframes.
- Warehouse C showed the lowest return efficiency (74.7%), indicating improvement opportunities.
- Positive correlation identified between delay days and turnaround time.
- Consistent use of Power BI DAX and Power Query for robust data cleaning and transformation.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
- **Power BI:** Data modelling, DAX, visual design
- **Power Query:** Data transformation and null handling
- **Excel:** Data preparation and validation
- **Data Analysis:** KPI design, performance comparison, trend interpretation
